# priority-and-severity-testcase
In software testing, Priority and Severity are used to classify bugs and help the team decide which ones to fix first and how critical they are to the system.

# Severity – Describes the impact of a defect
It shows how badly the bug affects the functionality of the application.

Set by the tester based on the seriousness of the defect.

Examples:
High Severity: System crash, data loss.

Low Severity: UI misalignment or spelling error.

# Priority – Describes the urgency to fix the defect
It tells how soon the bug should be fixed.

Set by developers or managers based on business needs.

Examples:
High Priority: Bug on the login page – needs quick fix.

Low Priority: Error in rarely used admin page.

# Why It Matters:
Severity helps understand how dangerous a bug is.

Priority helps decide which bug gets fixed first based on timelines and business value.
